    <h1>Guidelines and Policies</h1>
    <p>
        If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the great foodie moments you have. Bouquets 
        when the food exceeds your expectations, brickbats when the service is shocking, chronicles of your 
        food excursions â€“ they all count. <br> <br>
        While we welcome your opinions and descriptions of your dining experiences, there are a few things we 
        expect from every user on Zomato. Your reviews and photos, as well as your profile and the comments
         you share, are all subject to Content Guidelines, our Foodie Code of Conduct. <br><br>
         If your activity on Zomato doesn't match up to these content guidelines, we reserve the right to take 
         action as we deem necessary. This could include altering or deleting your reviews or comments, 
         restricting your review activity or deleting your Zomato account altogether, with or without notice. 
         Zomato also utilizes an algorithm to aid in removing suspicious reviews. <br><br>
    </p>  
    <h1>Foodie Code of Conduct</h1>
    <h2>Keep out the clutter</h2>
    <p>
        To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality content that's useful to 
        everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long for dine-in reviews. That's just about
         the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover the food, 
         service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters. We do not have a 140 characters limit
          for an online order review. However, if any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the 
          review altogether.
    </p>
    <h2>Keep it relevant</h2>
    <p>
        Please keep your contributions relevant to Zomato. Accounts placing irrelevant, inappropriate or 
        promotional content, reviews with server names, reviews with similar digital signatures that spam 
        restaurants or are based on any already disclaimed or informed policies and practices of a restaurant 
        may be deleted without notice. If your review has been removed or moderated by us and if you repost 
        another experience for the same restaurant, we reserve the right to remove that review too, even 
        though such review might be in line with our content guidelines. In the case of spam, we can restrict
         your review activity on Zomato.
    </p>
    <h2>Keep it clean</h2>
    <p>Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed account of your meal, keep
         foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like you, hate junk and will
          delete it whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to) derogatory comments on 
          someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or indication of a personal 
          vendetta against a business and its associates.</p>
    <h2>Keep it fresh</h2>
    <p>Only one review per restaurant for a dine out experience and one review for each online order
         transaction can be submitted and your most recent experience at a place counts. That's what is going 
         to help people when they're trying to decide whether or not to eat there. You're free to edit and 
         update your review based on subsequent visits at any time. Reviews about old experiences 
         (more than 6 months old) will also be deleted from our platform.</p>
